                        <li><img src="images/labay.jpg" alt="" /><strong>Alex Labay</strong>Irrespective of its name, Geek Hub was created not for &#8220;nerds&#8221; themselves, but for people willing to get profound knowledge of the subject, conveyed in available form, which is not an easy task to do. But these guys really managed to do it, explaining even difficult terms and processes in a funky and understandable way. Such clubs are difficult to find even in Kyiv, taking into consideration that it is, in addition to all its advantages, absolutely free (which is really acute for our talented but poor coders:)). I was extremely lucky to have got to know about its opening and now try to do my best to apply the acquired information to my projects.</li>
                        <li><img src="images/chernov.jpg" alt="" /><strong>Alexandr Chernov</strong>I joined Geekhub because I wanted to learn from experts in the IT industry. I especially like that we are taught only what we will need in the production environment. The most important thing in Geekhub is that this program allows students and people with no experience to realize and implement their potential.</li>
                        <li><img src="images/tkachenko.jpg" alt="" /><strong>Alexander Tkachenko,</strong>the student of University of TechnologyI think Geekhub is a great opportunity to start your career in IT. I have been engaged in the web development for several years already but is not possible to keep in step with all technology trends . Geekhub &#8211; is exactly what we need. You ask me what it can offer? The answer is rather simple but precise &#8211; really new technologies, new knowledge and of course new friends.</li>
                        <li><img src="images/urbanas.jpg" alt="" /><strong>Andrey Urbanas</strong>When I first learned about Geekhub, I said to myself &#8220;These guys teach programming for free and I have free time on my hands, why not join? It&#8217;s a great chance to talk to experts about questions I have&#8221;. Geekhub helps me do what I love.</li>
                        <li><img src="images/zenkov.jpg" alt="" /><strong>Nikolay Zenkov</strong>The main advantage of Geekhub lies within it&#8217;s altruistic goals. Today universities in Cherkasy don&#8217;t offer proper level of knowledge to work in software development. That&#8217;s why Geekhub is a wonderful opportunity for students to get necessary skills. For me Geekhub is constant contact with experienced developers, staying on top of latest web technology and methods of implementation.</li>
                        <li><img src="images/voloshin.jpg" alt="" /><strong>Oleg Voloshin</strong>Geekhub is a great start for everyone who wishes to make IT their primary occupation. Here you have a chance to learn from people who have significant experience is the industry and can provide qualified help and advice. An important factor in the learning process is the homework, where we practice learned in class.</li>
                        <li><img src="images/tinyaev.jpg" alt="" /><strong>Olexand Tinyayev</strong>Geekhub gives me a chance to realize my potential in IT. I don&#8217;t only receieve theoretical knowledge, but instantly convert it to practical skills thanks to the mastery and exeprience of our teachers.</li>
                        <li><img src="images/bulgakov.jpg" alt="" /><strong>Sergey Bulgakov</strong>Geekhub gave me a great incentive to learn web technologies, provided a perspective on this very fascinating area with good employment opportunities. I just wanted to say that it&#8217;s a pleasure learning from people who want to teach and do it because they want to share their knowledge. Such atmosphere truly inspires the hunger for knowledge.</li>
                        <li><img src="images/tsibrovski.jpg" alt="" /><strong>Sergey Tsibrovski</strong>Geekhub is a place where a novice programmer can receive necessary knowledge which can help them start a career in IT. The prorgram helps me apply my knowledge to real world tasks, something that I cannot get in the university.</li>
                        <li><img src="images/chernobay.jpg" alt="" /><strong>Vlad Chernobay</strong>I&#8217;m the one of the members of GeekHub. As for me this is a great opportunity to get basic knowledge in web-development, and a good start as a web-developer. Nowadays it&#8217;s hard to study by yourself: internet is huge and it&#8217;s hard to find relevant information, books are better but it takes a lot of time to read and, especially, to understand 1 book with 800-1000 pages. So this kind of program makes it easier and faster to study, especially for free =)</li>
                        <li><img src="images/labaj2.jpg" alt="" /><strong>Sergey Vlasov</strong>For me Geekhub is an opportunity to be in the company of web development professionals, exchanging ideas and experience, learning new and practical skills in web programming and a community of friendly like-minded people of course.</li>
